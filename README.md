React Native for "60 days".

## 🚀 React Native 60 Days Challenge (Aug 1 – Sep 30)

I'm learning React Native in 60 days by building 6 major mobile projects — one every 10 days — and posting my progress daily.

Each day, I’ll update this README with what I learned, what I built, and any challenges I faced.
